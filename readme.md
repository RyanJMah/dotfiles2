# My Dotfiles

Second iteration of my dotfiles, designed to be more minimal, lightweight, and have
as little dependencies as possible. For example, no longer requires sudo apt install
or brew install.

For the original iteration of my dotfiles, see [here](https://github.com/RyanJMah/dotfiles).

## Dependencies

Requires python3 and pip. Installation has some dependencies as well,
install them via pip.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
